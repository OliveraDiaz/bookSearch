## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To use, simply go to the URL provided. Login or create and account.

## Contribution
Login and sign up are working. Contributers can help with the Save this Book functions that still need to be functional. GraphQL is functioning so you can use to help debug. When I add a new code, something breaks and the login and signup stops working. 

## Test
NA
